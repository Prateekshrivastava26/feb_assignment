1. What do you mean by an array?
Ans. It refers to index collection of fixed no of homogeneous data elements.
Single variable holding multiple values which improves readabilitd of the program.

2.How to create an array.
Ans.  int[] a;
      a=new int[5];
      or
      int[] a =new int[5];
3.  Can we change the size of an array at run time
Ans.  You can't change the size of the array after it's constructed. 

4.Can you declare an arry without assigning the size of an array
Ans. Yes. We can declare an array without size but before using it needs to be initialized.

5.What is the default value of an array?
Ans. 0 if they are a numeric type ( int or double ), false if they are of type boolean , or null if they are an object type like String .

6.What is the 1-D array with an example?
Ans.A one-dimensional array in Java is a collection of similar types of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It is also known as a linear array or a single-dimensional array.
 

7.Write a program on two dimentional array

Ans.
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix = new int[3][4];

        matrix[0][0] = 1;
        matrix[0][1] = 2;
        matrix[0][2] = 3;
        matrix[0][3] = 4;

        matrix[1][0] = 5;
        matrix[1][1] = 6;
        matrix[1][2] = 7;
        matrix[1][3] = 8;

        matrix[2][0] = 9;
        matrix[2][1] = 10;
        matrix[2][2] = 11;
        matrix[2][3] = 12;

        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
                System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println(); 
        }
    }
}
