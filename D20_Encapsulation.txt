1.What is encapsulation in java? Why is it called data hiding?
Ans-Encapsulation in Java is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that involves bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class. It helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing necessary functionalities through methods.

ex-
public class Person {
  private String name;
  private int age;

  public Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }

  public void setAge(int age) {
    this.age = age;
  }
}


2.What are the important features of encapsulation?
Ans.Data protection
    Information hiding
   Abstraction
 Separating complexity


3.What are getter and setter methods in java explain with an example?
Ans.Getter and setter methods are methods in Java that are used to access and modify the private members of a class. The getter method is used to get the value of a private member, and the setter method is used to set the value of a private member.

ex -
public class Person {
  private String name;

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
}



4.What is the use of this keyword explin with an example?
Ans.The this keyword in Java is a reference to the current object. It can be used to refer to the instance variables and methods of the current object. It can also be used to call constructors.

ex-
class MyClass {
  int x;

  MyClass(int x) {
    this.x = x;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyClass myClass = new MyClass(10);
    System.out.println(myClass.x); // Output: 10
  }
}



5.What is the advantage of encapsulaition?
Ans.Data protection
Reduced errors
Improved maintainability
Easier to understand
Increased flexibility
Freedom to implement



6.How to achieve encapsulation in java with example.
Ans.

public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
